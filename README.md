# Cluster analysis by same Aptos receiver address

This repository is an add-on to our report about clustering wallets based on the Aptos receiver 

Primary proof - all the EVM wallets in this report sent funds to the same Aptos receiver

Secondary proof - we checked the timestamps of Aptos bridging transactions, if they were close, it is a mostly solid evidence that the cluster is indeed sybil

Third proof - using software and hands we looked at the similarity of the wallets in the cluster, which could easily strengthen the first 2 statements

Clusters_analysis contains an indepth analysis of all of the clusters of this report

Code directory contains most of the code used during the analysis and clustering
