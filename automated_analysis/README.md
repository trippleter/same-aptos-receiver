This repo is for other 12 clusters that we didn't analyze manually, however, we generated some reports based on the data collected.

We beleive that same Aptos receiver, close timestamps and identical transactions on different chains are all strengthening the fact that these wallets 
(inside each cluster) are controlled by 1 entity, thus they are sybil. 

However, the decisicion to include them or not is yours.

cluster_X_list.txt contains a list of all the wallets in a certain cluster
cluster_X_onchain_data.csv contains identical transactions conducted on the same date by EVERY wallet in a cluster generated by our software
custer_X_size_Y_aptos_bridge_data.csv contains the justification on why the cluster is formed the way it is (shows the transactions where each wallet bridged funds to the same Aptos wallet)


All the wallets and data from this report are found in auto_data.csv and auto_list.csv
