This repo is for other 12 clusters that we didn't analyze manually, however, we generated some reports based on the data collected.

We beleive that same Aptos receiver, close timestamps and identical transactions on different chains are all strengthening the fact that these wallets /
(inside each cluster) are controlled by 1 entity, thus they are sybil. 

However, the decisicion to include them or not is yours.
