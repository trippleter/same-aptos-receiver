As you can see from the cluster_7_size_55_aptos_bridge_data.csv file, all the Aptos transactions occured on Optimism network:

We can see that all transactions occurred within 1 hour (2023-06-27 06:42:27.000 - 2023-06-27 07:37:51.000):

Our custom similarity software pointed out that all wallets in this cluster (55/55) on Optimism called such functions as:

- 0xca23bb4c, on date: 2023-06-27, called LayerZero: Token Bridge

And on Polygon:

- 0xd6bf315a, on date: 2023-07-09, called 0x51227394cdeb108af1312c9815f399a882172d02

(These transaction data is in cluster_7_onchain_data.csv file)

These wallets are also directly linked through BTC.b transfer transactions. 0x0607e14a9614ab6d5f8ead01c3ca33c08905fd3a this is the distributor. Arbitrum and other networks also look identical (arbitrum: receive <1$ in ETH, then make a testnet bridge on most of the wallets)

Given the direct link of this cluster and the clustering by same Aptos wallet receiver method, we are 100% sure this indeed is a sybil cluster of 55 wallets.
