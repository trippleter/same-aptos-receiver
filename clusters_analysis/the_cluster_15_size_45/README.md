This cluster is quite not obvious, as he made all the Aptos transactions on different dates (most of the days are consequtive, but sometimes they occur in different months)

Starting the research from AVAX chain, we see that this guy tried to randomize transactions, but there is one identical pattern on all the wallets:

He is adding around 500$ of liquidity, and removing in a couple of minutes, then interacts with Holograph. This sybil is quite smart as he used different routes, but overall all transactions look similar.
Also we see a creation date of 152 days (as of May 29) shown on Debank, which also adds up to the arguments above.

Thus, considering that he sent money to the same Aptos wallet, identical patterns on AVAX and other networks, clear non-organic activity (add/remove liq in low period of time) and creation date by DeBank, we can conclude this is a sybil cluster.
