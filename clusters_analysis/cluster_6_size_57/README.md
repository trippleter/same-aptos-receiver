As you can see from the cluster_6_size_57_aptos_bridge_data.csv file, all the Aptos transactions occured on Arbitrum network:

We can see that all transactions occurred within 2 days (2023-04-16 15:53:14.000 - 2023-04-18 17:51:34.000):

At first glance we see a lot of similar deposit-to-aevo transactions with really low value.

However, there is an even more obvious point that tells us that the accounts are controlled by 1 person:â€¨Last wallet - 0xe5bfcb21e1e63de3c01622fac16b68630aa22955 directly sent 0.02 JOE to every wallet in the cluster:

Given the direct link of this cluster and the clustering by same Aptos wallet receiver method, we are 100% sure this indeed is a sybil cluster of 68 wallets.
