BNB chain activity is 100% identical: OmniBridge use on 06/19, then socket, woo bridge & core dao 06/22, then pandra 08/09. Moreover, Debank shows the same creation date - 367 days ago.

These are tangible evidence (along with identical Aptos Receiver address) that these wallets are controlled by the same person.
