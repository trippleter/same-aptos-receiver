As you can see from the cluster_2_size_68_aptos_bridge_data.csv file, all the Aptos transactions occured on Optimism network. Looking at the timestamps - we see 2 sub-clusters:

12 wallets sent a message on 06-29, and the rest on 07-02, which is still pretty similar (just a 3 day difference)

Let's analyze more onchain behaviour of these wallets:

â€¨Our custom similarity software pointed out that all wallets in this cluster (68/68) on Arbitrum called such functions as:

- 0xae30f6ee, on date: 2023-06-12, called 0x0a9f824c05a74f577a536a8a0c673183a872dff4

and on Polygon such functions as:

- 0x5154c0b4, on date: 2023-07-16, called 0xa184998ec58dc1da77a1f9f1e361541257a50cf4
(These transaction data is in cluster_2_onchain_data.csv)

Manual Analysis:

Debank shows the creation date of 369 days ago (as of May 27) on all wallets. Arbitrum network is absolutely identical: receive a total of 1$ in ETH in 2 txs, then call testate bridge on 06-12. Notice the balances are also similar - around 10$ on each account.

Avalanche network activity is also identical: 
Receive under 5$ in USDC and some AVAX for gas. Then make some LayerZero volume on Abracadbra.

Given all of the above and the clustering by same Aptos wallet receiver method, we are 100% sure this indeed is a sybil cluster of 68 wallets.
