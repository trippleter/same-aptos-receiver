As you can see from the cluster_8_size_51_aptos_bridge_data.csv file, almost all the Aptos transactions occured on BNB Chain:

We can see that this guy is a bit smarter than the previous ones, he uses different timestamps and tries to randomize his transactions, however, arbitrum network obviously shows that he is a sybil:

BNB chain also looks similar, and shows the spam of Core Dao Bridge transactions in order to farm the message countâ€¨

Given all of the above and the clustering by same Aptos wallet receiver method, we are 100% sure this indeed is a sybil cluster of 51 wallets.
