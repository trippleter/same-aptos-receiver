As you can see from the cluster_10_size_50_aptos_bridge_data.csv file, all of the Aptos transactions occured on Arbitrum network:

Most of them within 3 hours on 2023-09-17 15:00:00.000 - 18:05:25.000
And there were 3 wallets that made a tx on 2023-09-20

Arbitrum chain looks fully identical with transaction on claiming The Odyseey gale oat, then wrapping a couple of Wei to WETH, and spamming with LPT token transactions:

Given the similarity in timestamps, the obvious spam of transactions and the clustering by same Aptos wallet receiver method, we are 100% sure this indeed is a sybil cluster of 50 wallets.
