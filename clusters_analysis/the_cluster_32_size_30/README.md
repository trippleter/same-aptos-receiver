As you can see from the cluster_32_size_30_aptos_bridge_data.csv file, all of the Aptos transactions occurred on Polygon network:

Start: 2023-04-20 04:21:02.000 (https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xc48757222efc0e3b6ab88357fb7e4520dcf038b06ffcd107fa5154dbc1ff5305)

Finish: 2023-04-26 04:05:02.000 (https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xd2692018b8aa89763da5e286fa2ef7f80fa39149290e381411e042b7d2a71d80)

All the Aptos transactions occurred within: 5 days, 23 hours, 44 minutes

On Ethereum network we see fully identical dates and values of ETH transfers (04/29 - 2 deposits of ~2.5 ETH then withdrawal, 05/31 - again same thing)

Optimism also looks non-organic and as if they used a bot without randomization (except the sum, however, it is really close to 10k USDC):

These arguments only strengthen my point about same receiver wallet being a good way of classifying sybil activity between clusters
